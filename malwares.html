        <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Virus</h1>
        <p>According to malwarebytes.com, this type of malware is characterized by the fact that it spreads to the victim's computer and systems when the infected files are opened. The infected files can, for example, be sent in an email or message on social media. By doing this, a hacker can create a virus on the other side of the globe and then send it in an e-mail anywhere to cause damage.
          Most people who get or have experienced problems with their computer after downloading something from the internet or clicking on links they have been sent say they have got a virus. In most cases, they have not received a virus but a type of malware.
          The aim of a virus is for the infected files to infect new computers and systems. In order for the virus to be able to spread, someone is needed who manually performs actions. The process does not run automatically as with other types of malware (Malwarebytes, 2023a).

        <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Worm</h1>
        <p>This type of malware is very similar to viruses, but the biggest difference is, according to (Malwarebytes, 2023b), that viruses need some manual actions to spread, while a worm, on the other hand, spreads automatically.
           The way a worm spreads to new victims can be by using information that the victim has available on their system.
           Examples of this are contacts on e-mail and social media. Using social engineering a hacker can create an email with an attached file containing a worm.
           The email needs to be so interesting that the victim can’t hold back its curiosity and then opens the attached file.
           Some of the characteristics of a worm are if the computer/system becomes extremely slow, switches off without warning, crashes or if many error messages appear. </p>

        <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Trojan</h1>
        <p>Almost everyone has heard about the historical event that happened in the ancient Greek history. A big wooden horse was given as a gift of peace to the city named Troy. What they didn’t know was that the horse was filled with soldiers hiding and waiting to attack. Just like the old history event, a trojan malware works in a likewise way. It tricks the victim and use social engineering to make the victim run programs that looks legitime but in reality, the program hides a lot of malicious code.
          The are many different types of trojans and hackers chose the type based on what their intention is. According to (Malwarebytes, 2023c) downloading cracked applications, unknow free programs, opening infected attachments and visiting shady websites is examples of how to be affected by a trojan infection.

            <h1 class="w3-text-teal"><br>Ransomware</h1>
            <p>When this type of malware aims to lock access to systems and personal files, it may also enable the attacker to gain control over a personal computer's webcam and record everything it does. To regain access to systems, personal files, or to ensure the attacker deletes the recordings, the victim is required to pay a ransom. The amount varies depending on the victim. A private individual cannot afford to pay several million to regain access to their private files, unlike a large and well-known company. In most cases, the attackers prefer to receive the ransom in cryptocurrency. This is because it is nearly impossible to trace the money transfer.
              The attackers employ various unauthorized access methods, also known as infection methods. According to (Malwarebytes, 2023d), some examples of these methods include malspam, malvertising, spear phishing, and social engineering. In most cases, files and data are encrypted once an attacker gains access using one or more of these methods.

            <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Spyware</h1>
            <p>This type of malware is designed to spy on its victims. As with most malware, computers and systems are infected by the victims downloading programs, files, receiving e-mails or the like that contain harmful files. Once spyware has entered the computer, the attacker can monitor the activity.
              By monitoring the activity, the attacker can obtain sensitive information such as passwords, usernames, payment information and messages you send and receive (Malwarebytes, 2023e) The program usually works in the background and can be difficult to detect. The data that is retrieved can be used for identity theft and unauthorized surveillance.
